# Hi, I'm Caio

I’m a Data Analyst focused on designing structured analytics systems that enable reliable and scalable business decision-making.

Rather than only building dashboards, I focus on transforming raw data into well-modeled analytical layers that allow teams to measure performance, understand behavior, and act with confidence.

My approach combines technical rigor (SQL, data modeling, transformations) with a strong focus on business context. I aim to build analytics foundations that teams can trust and grow with.

## What I Focus On

- Translating business questions into structured data problems
- Designing clean analytical datasets
- Building SQL transformations using CTEs and window functions
- Creating reliable KPI layers for decision-makers

- Python (pandas, data preparation, EDA)
- Power BI (semantic modeling & performance optimization)
- Databricks & PySpark (data transformation pipelines)

## Current Direction

Developing end-to-end analytics projects simulating real business environments (SaaS metrics, revenue analysis, churn behavior, and scalable data modeling).
